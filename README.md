# HealthRecord Pro Tool

This tool empowers Clinical Research, Patient Billing, Compliance & Privacy, and Medical Analytics teams to extract critical insights from raw patient records and clinical data.

### Features

Clinical Administration: Quickly extract common billing codes (ICD, CPT) and service line frequencies for operational planning.
Patient Billing: Auto-summarize patient insurance details, co-payment structures, and treatment costs for streamlined invoicing.
Compliance & Privacy: Flag potential PHI (Protected Health Information) disclosure risks or identify missing consent form attestations within unstructured notes.
Research & Analytics: Auto-categorize patient demographics, diagnoses, and treatment outcomes for rapid cohort analysis, study feasibility, and grant reporting.

### How it works

Input raw clinical notes, patient record exports (e.g., CSV, TXT, or direct EHR dumps), or de-identified datasets and receive a structured JSON output or a pre-formatted dataset highlighting key patient, diagnosis, and treatment insights.
